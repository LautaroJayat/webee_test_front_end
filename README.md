# Front end for the Sensors Challenge

## Instructions
* Download this repo
* Install all dependencies running `npm install` or `yarn`, or using your prefered dependency management strategy.
* Make sure you have the Angular Cli. If you don't you can get it [here](https://cli.angular.io/)
* I strongly suggest running the aplication with the development server, which will make things lot easier.
In order to do this, first run the NodeJS server using **`yarn start:dev`** using the default **`test.dev`** (which is provided in that repo). Then go to the root of the project and run **`ng serve --open`**. This should compile and serve the aplication in your default browser.

* Once you are in the main page, you should click in the "sign in" link, make a user, then "login" and enjoy the experience.
Here are some pictures of how the views shoould look:
